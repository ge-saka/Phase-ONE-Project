# Phase-ONE-Project
Analyzing Box office movies  using three datasets to help Microsoft open a New movie Studio

Microsoft has decided to start creating video content by starting a new movie studio.
In this project we explore what types of films are currently doing the best in the box office and translate the findings into actionable insights.

I use three datasets. The imdb database,tn dataset and bom.movie_gross.csv file.
I import the libraries required to data clean these data sets.

# for data manipulation
import pandas as pd 
# for numeric computation
import numpy as np 
# for ploting our data and creating visualization
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt 
%matplotlib inline
import seaborn as sns
# To ignore warnings
import warnings

# Connect to the  database
read csv files and merge using python code.
